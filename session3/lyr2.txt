Somebody come to the floor, it feels like we've met before

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Chopped and screwed up
I'm a pothead, true enough
At your ex's crib and you're boo'd up
Take it slow baby, we in no rush
Hennessy or Don Q, that's a very hard choice
For the diamonds on my pinky, need a gang of cool points
And the drop head make 'em drop dead, yeah
Ye ain't scared, ye ain't scared, ye ain't scared, yeah
Believe me, I'm out here, you see me, in action
I've heard a lot, a lot about you
Passin' round blunts like a hot potato
And you dancin' on the table, gushin' like volcano

[Hook]
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come tip her, she's dancin' like a stripper
Somebody come get her, she's feelin' all the liquor
