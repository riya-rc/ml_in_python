Machine learning-system leaarns on its own and predicts it by experience and data
eg: 2 4 5=3 //predicts sign
input dat are features:x
output are labels:f(x)

predicts marks
bias=a constant that we add
best waits
eg= marks=assgn*2+8*hour study+ early marks*4+c
2,8,4 are weights

udacity: gaming se car train stops at traffic

predicts blood cells count in health
snapchat


k=3 //size of word
input 	output	freq
oun			t 	2
the 		y 	1
the 		-	2	//more freq predicts


dictionary is formed

d={
"oun":{
	"t":2
}
}
d["oun"][["t"]]=2

features and labels next one do in loop
