globals()			//gives name of global variable
eg:
a=10
def x():
	a=20		//a+=10 is wrong since a=a+10 no local a earlier
	print(a)


x()
print(a)	//20  10

// dont  use global variable in function

// global a // specify then change
a=a+10
//out: 20 20

* parenthesis has to be there
*FUNCTION IS AN OBJECT AND EVERYTHING IS AN OBJECT THEREFORE FUNC WITHIN FUNC IS VALID
INTERPRETED LANGUAGE

CLOSURE: goes to closest value
Shares same global

*nonlocal:goes to closest defing variable
	a=10
def x():
	a=20
	def y():	#closures func within func
		nonlocal  a		#goes to closest a
		a+=100
		print(a)
	y()
	print(a)

x()
print(a)	

DONT DO PASS BY VALUE AND REFERENCE IN PYTHON

* a,b=b,a
